Introduction
------------

The Friend Thumbnail  system is used to cache  preview images of file content in
the database. This allows us  to track thumbnails, save bandwidth  and generally
make users happy.


How it works
------------

When a user asks for a thumbnail, a path is provided. If the file isn't found by
path + userid, the system attempts to create a thumbnail. Then it  is registered
with the current date and time. The next time the system is asked, the thumbnail
is retrieved by referencing the file path from the database.

FThumbnail table
----------------

`ID` bigint(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, | Unique, incremental ID
`UserID` bigint(20) NOT NULL,            | The user who asks for thumbnail 
`Path` varchar(255) NOT NULL,            | The user's disk path
`Filepath` varchar(255) NOT NULL,        | The path on the server
`DateCreated` datetime,                  | Date thumbnail is created
`DateTouched` datetime,                  | Date thumbnail is seen/used
`Encryption` varchar(255),               | Future support for encrypted thumbs

TODO:
-----

 * Configurable autocleaning of thumbnails that are older than XX days
 * Elegant cleanup of nonexistent files (ganitor function)
 * Encrypted thumbnails for decryption on the client side
