How to compile Friend Unifying Platform
---------------------------------------

If you want to compile Friend Core manually, please read this file.

1) Dependencies

When developing FriendUP, we tried to keep the list of dependencies
as low as possible while keeping dependencies where was required
and logical. The current list of dependencies for Debian or Ubuntu
based Linux distributions:

	libssh2-1-dev
	libssh-dev
	libssl-dev
	libaio-dev
	php5-cli
	php5-curl
	php5-mysql
	php5-gd
	php5-imap
	php5-readline
	mysql-server
	libmysqlclient-dev
	build-essential
	libmatheval-dev
	libmagic-dev
	libgd-dev
	rsync
	valgrind-dbg
	libwebsockets-dev
	libxml2-dev

To install these, copy and paste the following in a terminal:

	sudo apt-get install libssh2-1-dev libssh-dev libssl-dev libaio-dev \
        php5-cli php5-curl php5-mysql php5-gd php5-imap mysql-server \
        libmysqlclient-dev build-essential libmatheval-dev libmagic-dev \
        libgd-dev libwebsockets-dev rsync valgrind-dbg libxml2-dev php5-readline

2) Compiling

a) Config
Before you start a configuration, you have to create a 'Config' file at the root
oof the friendup directory. This file contains the path where Friend Core will
be built. It's structure is the following :
FRIEND_PATH=/my/path/to/friend
Please note that the 'install.sh' script creates this file automatically.
If 'Config' is not found, Friend Core will be built in friendup/build.

b) Compilation
Once you have installed the dependencies, and created the Config file,
the way to compile and install Friend is as follows:

    To setup things :
	    make clean
	    make setup
	To compile the debug version of Friend Core :
	    make compile
	To compile the release version of Friend Core :
	    make release
	To copy the necessary files into the build directory :
	    make install
	You can do this in one command :
	    make clean setup release install
	    make clean setup compile install

You will find FriendCore executable in the build directory defined in the
'Config' file.

3) Creating the cfg.ini file

Friend Core relies on a cfg.ini file to be present in the build/cfg
directory. You will find in the 'docs' directory an example of such a file.

Important fields:

[DatabaseUser]                      // Defines the access to the mysql database
dbname = friendup                   // Name of the database used by Friend Core
login = friendup                    // Name of the database user for Friend Core
password = friendupuserpassword     // Password for the user
host = localhost                    // Host of mysql
port = 3306                         // Port of mysql

[FriendCore]                        // Friend Core variables
fchost = test.localfriend           // The host on which Friend Core is to run
port = 6502                         // The port number to access Friend Core
fcupload = storage/                 // Where to store data

[Core]                              // Other definitions
port = 6502                         // Same as above
SSLEnable = 1                       // 0 for no TLS, 1 for TLS
                                    // If enabled, you must have certificate.pem
                                    // and key.pem in the cfg/crt folder

[FriendNetwork]
enabled = 1                         // Indicates that Friend Network is enabled
                                    // (1) or not (0). If enabled,
                                    // Friend Network also needs it's server
                                    // to be running.
                                    // Friend Network also needs TLS keys
                                    // to be defined in build/cfg/crt

[FriendChat]
enabled = 1                         // Indicates that Friend Chat is enabled.
                                    // (0) = not enabled, (1) = enabled*
                                    // Friend Chat needs both a Presence server
                                    // and a Friend Chat server to function.
                                    // Friend Chat also needs TLS keys to be
                                    // defined in build/cfg/crt

4) Please read this

We strongly suggest that you install Friend with the options you want before
compiling it yourself. For this, use the 'install.sh' script that you can find
at the root of the friendup directory.
This script will create all the necessary configuration files for you, and
install Friend Network and Friend Chat servers if you have selected the options.
Once this done, you are free to compile Friend Core manually if you wish : the
compilation and installation does not erase the configuration files.
