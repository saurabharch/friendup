# Welcome to Friend Core

Friend Core is the heart of FriendUP.  We call it a Liquid Software Kernel.
It is what you get if you cross an operating system kernel with a web server -
turning it into a "streaming operating system" that allows FriendUP to access
resources and data in the cloud.
Once you have learned how to make use of Friend Core, you will have become an advanced user.

Friend Core has been designed with these goals in mind:

- be as fast as possible and as close to the machine as possible (written in low-level languages like C)
- work on anything, first on Linux (Ubuntu 14 or 16 recommended at the moment)
- work on low-end machines, like Raspberries or Pine64
- easy to install, simple to configure
- support for a large number of users, economical in resources and network resources
- allow web browser based apps to be written in Javascript, giving access to
every low-level system of the server, through the use of a secure messaging system
- 256 bits encryption or higher right out of your browser and on the server
- engineered to offer liquid software server capability in the future
- expandable, open source and customizable

Friend Software Corporation is currently building user community platforms, please follow us to stay informed.

Our goal is to share our vision of an eternal, stable and "always better" meta machine,
open to the whole world. You have a opportunity to be part of this exciting
and visionary project today as a developer.
