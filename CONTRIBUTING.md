The contributor agreement is our vechile for ensuring that this project can enjoy commercial support and gain essential project management, as well as an open book development cycle on Github.

Committing to the repository
----------------------------

When committing to the Friend repository, we have the following guidelines to make sure that we do not fall into regressions and unexpected bugs. Keep in mind at all times that multiple developer may test and build Friend Core and the other Friend components at different intervals, so making sure that you as a developer do not break the build must be in strong focus at all times.

When following this guide, we will ensure that our Master branch is as stable as possible.

A message will be passed to the Team each time this document is updated.

Never commit directly to master
-------------------------------

When you are working on a new feature, or even a bugfix, make sure you are committing to a separate branch until you have made sure that your fix or feature is working.

1. Name your branch like this: dev-feature-myfeature
2. Once you have completed your code, merge Master into your branch to test with the updated common codebase
3. Contact your project manager and ask him or her to organize a test
4. Once your project manager have cleared your feature or bugfix as working, merge into Master

Project managers
----------------

Each major section of the Friend codebase is administered by a project manager. Please look at the page; project managers, for an updated list.
